            <p>
                With over 13 years of experience in emergency operations, including 8 years as a firefighter and more than 7 as a critical care paramedic. I've learned the value of teamwork, clear communication, and staying calm under pressure. My career has taught me to solve problems quickly, adapt to new challenges, and always put people first.
                <br /><br />
                Now, as I dive into web development, I'm excited to bring these skills into the tech world. I love learning new technologies and building creative solutions that make a difference. My approachable nature and collaborative spirit help me connect easily with others, whether working in a team or supporting clients.
                <br /><br />
                I'm passionate about delivering high-quality work, paying attention to detail, and always striving to improve. My background has given me resilience, empathy, and a strong work ethic. Qualities I believe make me a valuable addition to any team. I'm eager to grow as a developer and contribute to projects that have a real and lasting impact.
